# Composition

Composition is a restricted form of Aggregation in which two entities are highly dependent on each other.

It represents part-of relationship.    
In composition, both the entities are dependent on each other.    
When there is a composition between two entities, the composed object cannot exist without the other entity.    
Lets take example of Library.    

> Java program to illustrate the concept of Composition.    

```` 
class Book 
{
    public String title;
    public String author;
     
    Book(String title, String author)
    {      
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
    }
}
````    

````    
import java.util.*;

class Library 
{
 
    // The books in the Library.
    private ArrayList<Book> books;
    
    public void addBook(Book book){
       books.add(book);
    }
     
    public ArrayList<Book> getTotalBooksInLibrary(){
         
       return books;  
    }
     
}

````    

````    
class GFG 
{
    public static void main (String[] args) 
    {
         
        // Creating 3 new books
        Book b1 = new Book("EffectiveJ Java", "Joshua Bloch");
        Book b2 = new Book("Thinking in Java", "Bruce Eckel");
        Book b3 = new Book("Java: The Complete Reference", "Herbert Schildt");
         
        // Creating a Library (new Library()) and adding the 3 books to it.
        Library library = new Library();
        library.addBook(b1);
        library.addBook(b2);
        library.addBook(b3);
         
        ArrayList<Book> bks = library.getTotalBooksInLibrary();
        for(Book bk : bks){
             
            System.out.println("Title : " + bk.title + " and "
            +" Author : " + bk.author);
        }
    }
}
````    

Output
````    
Title : EffectiveJ Java and  Author : Joshua Bloch
Title : Thinking in Java and  Author : Bruce Eckel
Title : Java: The Complete Reference and  Author : Herbert Schildt
````    

In above example a library can have no. of books on same or different subjects. So, If Library gets destroyed then All books within that particular library will be destroyed. i.e. book can not exist without library. Thatâ€™s why it is composition.
